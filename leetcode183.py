# Table: Customers

# +-------------+---------+
# | Column Name | Type    |
# +-------------+---------+
# | id          | int     |
# | name        | varchar |
# +-------------+---------+
# id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
 

# Table: Orders

# +-------------+------+
# | Column Name | Type |
# +-------------+------+
# | id          | int  |
# | customerId  | int  |
# +-------------+------+
# id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
# customerId is a foreign key (reference columns) of the ID from the Customers table.
# Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
 

# Write a solution to find all customers who never order anything.

# Return the result table in any order.

# The result format is in the following example.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: 
# Customers table:
# +----+-------+
# | id | name  |
# +----+-------+
# | 1  | Joe   |
# | 2  | Henry |
# | 3  | Sam   |
# | 4  | Max   |
# +----+-------+
# Orders table:
# +----+------------+
# | id | customerId |
# +----+------------+
# | 1  | 3          |
# | 2  | 1          |
# +----+------------+
# Output: 
# +-----------+
# | Customers |
# +-----------+
# | Henry     |
# | Max       |
# +-----------+
